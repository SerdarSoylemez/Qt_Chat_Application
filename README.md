# Qt_Chat_Application

This project is a messaging application written using a server and client architecture. On the server side, user information is stored, and when registration is performed, these details are updated. On the client side, user login and registration processes are carried out. Depending on the accuracy of the entered user information, a window opens displaying the message the user has written along with the timestamp. On the left side of the message section, information about which user has logged into the system is kept.
